Improve your OOP skills
### Task
`FlighService` and package `service` represent a component of the system that holds a business logic. `FlightDao` 
and package `data` represent a component of the system that implements data access layer. Your job is to implement 
the *todo* section of those classes **following OOP design principles.**  

To verify your implementation, run `FlightSeriviceTest.java`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowladge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
